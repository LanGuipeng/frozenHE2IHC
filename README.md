**Background**

><font color="#000066">Abstract</font><br /> 

>>Breast cancer accounts for **12.5\%** of all new cancer cases worldwide, presenting a substantial threat to female health. Surgical intervention is essential in its treatment, with accurate and timely intraoperative diagnosis playing a vital role in enhancing patients' survival and future health. This ensures comprehensive tumor excision and reduces the likelihood of additional surgical procedures. Conventional frozen section analysis offers expedited feedback; however, due to the limited information provided, the confidence accuracy of intraoperative diagnosis is reduced. In contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides more detail but its protracted process is impractical intraoperatively. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning framework that leverages generative adversarial networks to transform intraoperative frozen slices into diagnostically valuable images, thus enhancing both the confidence accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis.
